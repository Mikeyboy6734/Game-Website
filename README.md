# CrazyGames-style Example (Next.js + Tailwind)

This is a minimal example that demonstrates a small game portal which hosts HTML5/JS games
in `/public/games/<slug>/index.html`. Built with Next.js and TailwindCSS.

How to use:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` â€” runs Next.js dev server
3. Add your own games to `public/games/<slug>/index.html` and add entries in `data/games.json`

Deploy: push to GitHub and connect to Vercel (default Next.js settings work).

Two demo games are included: Flappy Minimal and Snake Classic.
